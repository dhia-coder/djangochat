risk management plan,facet of,projects,the risk management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how risk management activities will be structured and performed the risk management plan may include some or all of the following elements risk strategy describes the general approach to managing risk on this project methodology denes the specic approaches tools and data sources that will be used to perform risk management on the project roles and responsibilities denes the lead support and risk management team members for each type of activity described in the risk management plan and claries their responsibilities funding identies the funds needed to perform activities related to project risk management establishes protocols for the application of contingency and management reserves timing denes when and how often the project risk management processes will be performed throughout the project life cycle and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule risk categories provide a means for grouping individual project risks a common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure rbs which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk see example in figure an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identied risks the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects or there may be several rbs frameworks for different types of projects or the project may develop a tailored rbs where an rbs is not used an organization may use a custom risk categorization framework which may take the form of a simple list of categories or a structure based on project objectivesrbs level all sources of project risk technical risk management risk commercial risk external risk rbs level rbs level scope definition requirements definition

environmentalweather competition regulatory etcu stakeholder risk appetite the risk appetites of key stakeholders on the project are recorded in the risk management plan as they inform the details of the plan risk management process in particular stakeholder risk appetite should be expressed as measurable risk thresholds around each project objective these thresholds will determine the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure and they are also used to inform the denitions of probability and impacts to be used when assessing and prioritizing individual project risks definitions of risk probability and impacts denitions of risk probability and impact levels are specic to the project context and reect the risk appetite and thresholds of the organization and key stakeholders the project may generate specic denitions of probability and impact levels or it may start with general denitions provided by the organization the number of levels reects the degree of detail required for the project risk management process with more levels used for a more detailed risk approach typically ve levels and fewer for a simple process usually three table provides an example of denitions of probability and impacts against three project objectives these scales can be used to evaluate both threats and opportunities by interpreting the impact denitions as negative for threats delay additional cost and performance shortfall and positive for opportunities reduced time or cost and performance enhancement table example of definitions for probability and impacts scale probability

descriptive terms such as very high high medium low and very low or numeric values can be used for probability and impact where numeric values are used these can be multiplied to give a probabilityimpact score for each risk which allows the relative priority of individual risks to be evaluated within each priority level an example probability and impact matrix is presented in figure

role of project risk management in project management,subclass of,risk,project risk management is not an optional activity it is essential to successful project management it should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents in this way it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project in every phase and in every process group many of the project management processes address planning the project from concept to nal design and from procurement through daily management of execution and closeout these processes often assume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and therefore they need to include treatment of project risks project risk management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions therefore it builds upon and extends other project management processes for instance project scheduling provides dates and critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty quantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates and critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project project risk management is not a substitute for the other project management processes on the contrary project risk management requires that these project management processes eg scheduling budgeting and change management be performed at the level of the best practices available project risk management adds the perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk into account for instance risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and schedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of con dence for meeting project objectives there is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects in the early stages of a project the level of risk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum this situation does not mean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time rather there may be different ways of approaching the project that have different risk implications the more this situation is recognized the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be a risk management approach is applicable throughout a projects life cycle the earlier in the project life cycle that the risks are recognized the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be risk management continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available about all aspects and components of the project and its environment such as stakeholders scope time and cost as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints the balance between project exibility and knowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop it is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions agreements and contracts in place the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced during project execution risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new risks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed as well as check for existing risks that are no longer plausible project risk management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for the completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future finally throughout the project and during project closure riskrelated lessons are reviewed in order to contribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of project risk management practice,Project Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management. It should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents.

e nition of project risk,subclass of,risk,the word risk is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines its use in the pmbok guide fourth edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process descriptions the de nition of project risk given in the pmbok guide fourth edition is as follows project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or a negative effect on a projects objectives this de nition includes two key dimensions of risk uncertainty and effect on a projects objectives when assessing the importance of a project risk these two dimensions must both be considered the uncertainty dimension may be described using the term probability and the effect may be called impact though other descriptors are possible such as likelihood and consequence the de nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described and more general conditions which are less speci c but also may give risk to uncertainty the de nition of project risk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a projects objectives as well as those which could have a positive effect these two types of risk are called respectively threats and opportunities it is important to address both threats and opportunities within a uni ed project risk management process this allows for the gain of synergies and ef ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses and coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other risks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur but which would matter if they did occur it is important to distinguish risks from riskrelated features such as cause and effect causes are events or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise to risks effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk occurs the causeriskeffect chain can be used in a structured risk statement or risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described see section when a risk event occurs it ceases to become uncertain threats which occur may be called issues or problems opportunities which occur may be called bene ts both issuesproblems and bene ts entail project management actions that are outside the scope of the project risk management process,"Project risk is an uncertain event or condition that has a positive or a negative effect on a project’s objectives. It includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and more general conditions which are less speciﬁ c but also may give risk to uncertainty.",['pmbok guide fourth

individual risks and overall project risk,subclass of,risk,it is useful to consider project risk at two levels individual risks and overall project risk individual risks are speci c events or conditions that might affect project objectives an individual risk may positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives elements or tasks understanding individual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project success daytoday project risk management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the prospects of a successful project outcome overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks it represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome it is an important component of strategic decisionmaking program and portfolio management and project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set at these higher levels it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project establish the contingency reserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders set appropriate project priorities and judge whether the risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances,It is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk. Individual risks are speciﬁ c events or conditions that might affect project objectives.

stakeholder risk attitudes,instance of,brainstorming,the risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall project risk matters a wide range of factors in uence risk attitude these include the scale of the project within the range of stakeholders overall activities the strength of public commitments made about the performance of the project and the stakeholders sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts industrial relations and other factors stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased certainty in project outcomes and may express a preference for one project objective over another how risk is regarded is usually also strongly in uenced by an organizations culture different organizations are more or less open and this often impacts the way risk management can be applied understanding stakeholders attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning that precedes risk identi cation and analysis in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder satisfaction with the projects results these attitudes should be identi ed and managed proactively and deliberately throughout the project risk management process they may differ from one project to another for the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another in fact a single stakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project it is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where the team is international crossindustry or multiorganizational,The risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall project risk matters. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased  neurologicalcertainty in project outcomes.

project risk management and project management,subclass of,risk,all projects are uncertain uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings based on assumptions and constraints delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different requirements project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment through the use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating planning cost control task allocation earned value analysis monitoring and review meetings etc each of these elements of project management has a role in de ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects project risk management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood assessed and managed within projects as such it forms an integral part of project management and effective project risk management is a critical success factor for project success for project management to be fully effective however it is important that project risk management is not viewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task since many elements of project management address inherent uncertainty the interface between structured project risk management and the other processes of project management needs to be clear the outputs of project risk management should be taken into account within many of the project management processes they can for example impact estimating resource requirements cost or duration assessing the impact of proposed scope changes planning or replanning the forward strategy of the project allocating resources to tasks and reporting progress to stakeholders none of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved as determined during the project risk management process in other words project management process effectiveness is increased by using the information and results from project risk management in addition effective project risk management requires input from other project management processes outputs such as the work breakdown structure wbs estimates the project schedule assumptions list etc are all important prerequisites for effective project risk management,"All projects are uncertain.

project risk management processes,subclass of,risk,the de ned steps of project risk management describe a structured approach for understanding and managing risk on a project this chapter outlines the steps required for effective project risk management each step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters as previously de ned project risk is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives from this de nition it is clear that risks only exist in relation to objectives it is therefore essential at the start of the project risk management process to clearly de ne the objectives it is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk so each step in the project risk management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk scalable elements of the process include available resources methodology and processes used tools and techniques used supporting infrastructure review and update frequency and reporting requirements as a precondition for a successful project risk management implementation it is important to have a clear understanding of the risk thresholds that de ne the key stakeholders views on acceptable levels of risk as well as a framework against which identi ed risks can be assessed as a result the project risk management process always starts with an initiation step this is required in order to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach and parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project as well as the scope and objectives of the project risk management process itself project risk management activities resources and attention should be appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application the main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows de ne those objectives against which risks will be identi ed de ne how the elements of the project risk management process will be scaled for this project and de ne risk thresholds tolerances and the assessment framework the outputs from this initial step should be documented communicated and then reviewed by the stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the project risk management process the document should be formally approved at a senior level once the project risk management scope and objectives are agreed upon it is possible to start identifying risks being careful to distinguish genuine risks from nonrisks such as causes effects problems issues etc a variety of risk identi cation techniques is available each with its own strengths and weaknesses one or more techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the speci c project the aim is to expose and document all knowable risks recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and others will emerge later in the project the emergent nature of risk requires the project risk management process to be iterative repeating the identify risks process in order to nd risks which were not evident earlier in the project input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks since each will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project historical records and project documents should also be reviewed to identify risks for this project all identi ed risks are recorded ideally a risk owner is designated for each identi ed risk it is the responsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent project risk management processes following risk identi cation it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk in order to prioritize individual risks for further attention evaluate the level of overall project risk and determine appropriate responses risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks using quantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome or using both in combination these two approaches require different types of data but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used an integrated approach should be adopted qualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks considering a range of characteristics such as probability of occurrence degree of impact on project objectives manageability timing of possible impacts relationships with other risks common causes or effects etc understanding and prioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them so qualitative techniques are used on most projects the outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses quantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identi ed risks on the project outcome these techniques take into account probabilistic or projectwide effects such as correlation between risks interdependency and feedback loops thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project the result is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project the results of quantitative analysis should be used to focus the development of appropriate responses particularly the calculation of required contingency reserve levels and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions quantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk once individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood appropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal set of responses has been developed a range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and opportunities the risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk based on its characteristics and assessed priority ensuring that the strategy is achievable affordable cost effective and appropriate the use of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible the risk owner is responsible for de ning actions to implement the chosen strategy these actions may be delegated to action owners as appropriate the risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness and also to identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses in addition to individual risk responses actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk all response strategies and actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the project plan it is essential that agreedupon actions are implemented otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains unchanged it is also vital that the project risk management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout the life of the project this will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identi ed risks to identify emergent and secondary risks and to determine the effectiveness of the project risk management process the steps outlined previously form the project risk management process these are detailed in subsequent chapters as follows plan risk management chapter de nes the scope and objectives of the project risk management process and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project management identify risks chapter identi es as many knowable risks as practicable perform qualitative risk analysis chapter evaluates key characteristics of individual risks enabling them to be prioritized for further action perform quantitative risk analysis chapter evaluates the combined effect of risks on the overall project outcome plan risk responses

purpose and objectives of the plan risk management process,instance of,brainstorming,the objectives of the plan risk management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy for the project to decide how the risk management processes will be executed and to integrate project risk management with all other project management activities effective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan this plan describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they t in with the other project management processes on a broader level it describes the relationships among project risk management general project management and the management processes in the rest of the organization to provide the greatest bene t initial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project and the corresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan the risk management plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders become clearer or change although the project risk management processes form an integral part of the overall project management plan a budget in terms of resources cost and time for the speci c risk management activities should be established in order to better track control and as necessary defend the corresponding expenditures throughout the project the cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project budget while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated allocated and managed the risk management plan will de ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the corresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately as well as the conditions under which the approved budget for risk management can be modi ed in the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration risk management activities need to be repeated throughout the project the risk management plan should de ne both the normal frequency for repeating the processes as well as speci c or exceptional conditions under which the corresponding actions should be initiated the corresponding risk management activities should be integrated into the project management plan there are two categories of success criteria for risk management those for success of the project in general and those for success of project risk management projectrelated criteria to assess the success of project risk management the stakeholders must agree on an acceptable level of results for the projectrelated criteria such as cost time and scope in order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders the risk management plan should present these objectives with reference to the project de nition documents to provide guidance in risk management particularly in prioritizing risk responses stakeholders should also prioritize each project objective processrelated criteria the measures for success in project risk management depend on a number of factors such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project for example the project risk management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than for a project with a more predictable environment a research project risk management process may be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be allowable for a successful process in a more predictable project the level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant stakeholders the risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be in uenced by a number of factors all of which need to be identi ed these include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty and the relative importance to them of achieving or missing speci c project objectives the output of this analysis should then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the project risk management processes in the speci c project guidelines and rules for escalating riskrelated information to management and other stakeholders should re ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders the project manager should maintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves in order to become aware of any changes in the stakeholders attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts into account it is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks and that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be de ned in a manner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders if qualitative analysis uses such terms as high impact or medium probability these should be de ned objectively in the risk management plan similarly the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in quantitative analysis or for decisionmaking in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control risk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a template of the risk register that will be used for recording riskrelated information the risk management plan should also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various project risk management processes should be applied this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the speci ed risk management objectives in order for the project risk management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively the project team and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate their criteria for determining success their level of authority and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond this level the risk management plan speci es the projects risk management roles and responsibilities and de nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel riskrelated communication occurs at two levels a within the project team and b between the project team and the other project stakeholders the principles for each of these categories of communication are de ned in the risk management plan for the team the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various risk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding project risk management processes as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports for the other stakeholders the plan sets their expectations as to the structure content and frequency of routine documents to be received as well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events details of the information required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly de ned,The objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy for the project. The plan describes how the risk management processes should be carried out and how they should be integrated with the other project management processes.,['risk management plan may subsequently need'

purpose and objectives of the perform qualitative risk,instance of,brainstorming,analysis process the perform qualitative risk analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually identi ed project risks and prioritizes risks based on agreedupon characteristics assessing individual risks using qualitative risk analysis evaluates the probability that each risk will occur and the effect of each individual risk on the project objectives as such it does not directly address the overall risk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with each other this can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques see chapter one step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes if several risks arise from a common source sometimes called a root cause risk responses may be more effective when they focus on addressing this root cause identifying common effects from groups of risks allows identi cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure eg to the project completion date the budget or a particular deliverables scope facilitating risk response focus in these areas the methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the identify risks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most in uence positive or negative on achieving the projects objectives risks that are assessed as high priority to either threaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the plan risk responses process they may be further analyzed such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is discussed in perform quantitative risk analysis process,The Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process assesses and evaluates characteristics of individually project risks.

purpose and objectives of the perform quantitative risk,instance of,brainstorming,analysis process the perform quantitative risk analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on the objectives of the project based on current plans and information when considering risks simultaneously results from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate the likelihood of success in achieving project objectives and to estimate contingency reserves usually for time and cost that are appropriate to both the risks and the risk tolerance of project stakeholders it is generally accepted that analyzing uncertainty in the project using quantitative techniques such as monte carlo simulation may provide more realism in the estimate of the overall project cost or schedule than a nonprobabilistic approach which assumes that the activity durations or lineitem cost estimates are deterministic however it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate for all projects for example qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of effective risk responses especially for smaller projects therefore during the plan risk management process the bene ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the additional insights and value justify the additional effort partial risk analyses such as qualitative risk analysis aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time and therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously calculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the perform quantitative risk analysis process speci c project risks are usually best understood and quanti ed at a detailed level such as the lineitem cost or schedule activity level by contrast project objectives such as achievement of the projects budget or the schedule are speci ed at a higher level often at the level of the total project an overall risk analysis such as one that uses quantitative techniques estimates the implication of all quanti ed risks on project objectives the implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project elements examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or lineitem costs at a level of detail that lends itself to speci c assessment of individual risks including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements applying a quantitative method such as monte carlo simulation or decision tree analysis that incorporates multiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective results of the quantitative analysis will be compared to the project plan baseline or current to give management an estimate of the overall project risk and will answer important questions such as what is the probability of meeting the projects objectives how much contingency reserve eg reserves or buffers of time resources and cost is needed to provide the organization with the level of certainty it requires based upon its risk tolerance what are those parts of the project such as lineitem costs or schedule activities which contribute the most risk when all risks are considered simultaneously which individual risks contribute the most to overall project risk estimating overall project risk using quantitative methods helps distinguish those projects where quanti ed risks threaten objectives beyond the tolerance of the stakeholders from those for which the objectives are within acceptable tolerances even when risk is considered the former may be targeted for vigorous risk responses aimed at protecting those objectives most important to the stakeholders a highlevel comparison of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis processes is presented in figure figure comparison of qualitative and quantitative approaches,The Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process provides a numerical estimate of the overall effect of risk on the project.

identi cation techniques such as brainstorming ensures coverage of all types of risk tests for blind spots or omissions none requires a comprehensive rbs often tailored to the project rootcause analysis see chapter allows identi cation of additional dependent risks allows the organization to identify risks that may be related because of their common root causes basis for development of preemptive and comprehensive responses can serve to reduce apparent complexity most risk management techniques are organized by individual risk this organization is not conducive to identifying the root causes can oversimplify and hide existence of other potential causes there may be no valid strategy available for addressing the root cause once it has been identi ed ability to identify if a risk is an outcome of a more fundamental cause willingness by management to accept and address the root cause rather than adopting partial workarounds swot analysis ensures equal focus on both threats and opportunities offers a structured approach to identify threats and opportunities focus on internal organizational strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and threats focuses on

 estimating techniques applied to probability and impact,has part,uncertainty,the probability of a risk occurring can be speci ed in several different ways one common way is to assign levels of risk probability by ranges of probability one bene t of this approach is that the subject matter experts only need to assess a risks probability within a range rather than as a speci c value an example assuming that a probability and impact matrix is desired is shown in figure d where the probability ranges are more tightly de ned at low levels of probability examples of impact level de nitions are very projectspeci c the values used to specify the level of impact from very low to very high if a matrix is being used should be higher impact for threats or opportunities as they move from very low to very high for a speci c objective levels are de ned by the organization as causing the same amount of pain or gain to the project for each level across objectives if a risks possible impact is uncertain and could be assigned to more than one level of impact eg from moderate to high the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents the expected or average impact alternatively the risk may be agged for extra analysis in order to reduce the range of uncertainty to t within a single range an example of impact level de nitions is shown in figure d these de nitions should be tailored or scaled by stakeholders to the speci c project the de nitions appropriately tailored to the project can be used for opportunities and threats table d techniques for perform qualitative risk analysis continued figure d example of definitions for levels of probability and impact on four specific objectives used to evaluate individual risks noteopportunities are to be treated as representing a positive saving in time or cost or increased functionality for threats each impact scale is interpreted negatively ie time delays increased cost or reduced functionality,The probability of a risk occurring can be speciﬁ ed in several different ways. One common way is to assign levels of risk probability by ranges of probability. The values used to specify the level of impact should be from very low to very high (if a 5×5 matrix is being used) If a risk’s possible impact is uncertain the analyst may choose to assign the risk to the impact level that represents the expected or average impact.,['speci c objective levels' ' matrix' ' probability' 'four specific objectives used' 'perform qualitative risk analysis' 'impact level de nitions' 'impact level de nitions' 'speci c value' 'level across objectives' 'subject matter experts' 'several different ways' 'evaluate individual risks' 'analyst may choose' 'tightly de ned' 'one common way' 'speci c project' 'note opportunities' 'speci c' 'de nitions' 'de nitions' 'de ned' 'impact matrix' 'speci ed' 'one level' 'extra analysis' 'impact level' 'risk may' 'one bene' 'risk ' 'risk ' 'risk occurring' 'possible impact' 'impact scale' 'higher impact' 'average impact' ' agged' 'values used' 'table d' 'reduced functionality' 'positive saving' 'interpreted negatively' 'increased functionality' 'figure d' 'figure d' 'figure d' 'assign levels' 'risk probability' 'low levels' 'single range' 'range rather' 'time delays' 'increased cost' 'appropriately tailored' 'probability within' 'probability ranges' 'level' 'levels' '' '' 'risk' 'impact' 'impact' 'impact' 'used' 'used' 'probability' 'probability' 'probability' 'probability' 'range' 'opportunities' 'opportunities' 'within' 'time' 'tailored' 'ranges' 'project' 'project' 'project' 'cost' 'assign' 'low' 'low' '' 'uncertainty' 'uncertain' 'treated' 'threats' 'threats' 'threats' 'techniques' 'stakeholders' 'specify' 'shown' 'shown' 'scaled' 'represents' 'representing' 'reduce' 'pain' 'organization' 'order' 'need' 'move' 'moderate' 'high' 'high' 'high' 'gain' 'g' 'expected' 'examples' 'example' 'example' 'example' 'e' 'e' 'desired' 'definitions' 'could' 'continued' 'causing' 'assuming' 'assigned' 'assess' 'approach' 'amount' 'alternatively'],"d.3.1.2, d.3.1.3 analytic hierarchy process (ahp), d.4  techniques, examples and templates for perform quantitative risk, d.4.1 techniques for perform quantitative risk analysis, d.4.1.1 decision tree analysis, d.4.1.2 expected monetary value, d.4.1.3 monte carlo simulation, d.5.1 techniques for plan risk response, d.5.1.2 contingency reserve estimation, d.5.1.3 multi-criteria selection techniques, d.5.1.4 scenario analysis, d.6.1 techniques for monitor and control risks process, d.6.1.1 reserve analysis, d.6.1.4 status meetings, d.6.1.5 trend analysis, d.6.1.6 variance analysis",applied veri,"impact, level, probability, range, high, nition, low, functionality, assign, speci",

assumptions assumptions are factors that for planning purposes are considered to be true real or certain without proof or demonstration assumptions affect all aspects of project planning and are part of the progressive elaboration of the project project teams frequently identify document and validate assumptions as part of their planning process assumptions generally involve a degree of risk bene t positive effect on a project objective arising from the occurrence of an opportunity bias during information gathering about risk the source of information exhibits a preference or an inclination that inhibits impartial judgment types of bias which commonly affect the risk process include cognitive and motivational bias cause events or circumstances which currently exist and which might give rise to risks consequence see impact constraint the state quality or sense of being restricted to a given course of action or inaction an applicable restriction or limitation either internal or external to a project which will affect the performance of the project or a process contingency reserve the amount of funds budget or time needed above the estimate to reduce the risk of overruns of project objectives to a level acceptable to the organization contingency plan a plan developed in anticipation of the occurrence of a risk to be executed only if speci c predetermined trigger conditions arise decision tree analysis the decision tree is a diagram that describes a decision under consideration and the implications of choosing one or another of the available alternatives it is used when some future scenarios or outcomes of actions are uncertain it incorporates probabilities and the cost or rewards of each logical path of events and future decisions and uses expected monetary value analysis to help the organization identify the relative values of alternative actions effect conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the associated risk happened emergent risk a risk which arises later in a project and which could not have been identi ed earlier on identify risks the process of determining which risks

obtained a product to be produced or a service to be performed opportunity a condition or situation favorable to the project a positive set of circumstances a positive set of events a risk that will have a positive impact on project objectives or a possibility for positive changes contrast with threat overall project risk overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole overall project risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual elements or tasks it represents the exposure of

objective arising from occurrence of a threat project risk management project risk management includes the processes concerned with conducting risk management planning identi cation analysis responses and monitoring and control on a project the purpose of project risk management is to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease the probability and impact of events adverse to project objectives response strategy a highlevel approach to address an individual risk or overall project risk broken down into a set of risk actions risk an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs has a positive or negative effect on a projects objectives risk action a detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an individual risk or overall project risk risk action owner the person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a given risk also known as response owner when the context allows it risk attitude a chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals and groups driven by perception and evidenced by observable behavior risk attitude exists on a continuous spectrum but common risk attitudes include risk averse risk tolerant risk neutral and risk seeking risk breakdown structure rbs tool a hierarchically organized depiction of the identi ed project risks arranged by risk category and subcategory that identi es the various areas and causes of potential risks the risk breakdown structure is often tailored to speci c project types risk category a group of potential causes of risk risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical external organizational environmental or project management a category may include subcategories such as technical maturity weather or aggressive estimating see also risk breakdown structure rbs risk exposure a measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identi ed risks on objectives risk management plan the document describing how project risk management will be structured and performed on the project it is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan the risk management plan can be informal and broadly framed or formal and highly detailed based on the needs of the project information in the risk management plan varies by application area and project size the risk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks the results of risk analysis and the risk responses risk metalanguage a structured description of a risk which separates cause risk and effect a typical risk description using risk metalanguage might be in the form because of cause risk might occur which would lead to effect risk model a representation of the project including data about project elements and risks that can be analyzed by quantitative methods risk owner the person responsible for ensuring that an appropriate response strategy is selected and implemented and for determining suitable risk actions to implement the chosen strategy with each risk action assigned to a single risk action owner risk register the document containing the results of the qualitative risk analysis quantitative risk analysis and risk response planning the risk register details all identi ed risks including description category cause probability of occurring impacts on objectives proposed responses owners and current status risk threshold a measure of the level of risk exposure above which action must be taken to address risks proactively and below which risks may be accepted root cause an initiating cause that gives rise to a causal chain which may give rise to risks secondary risk a risk that arises as a direct result of implementing a risk response stakeholder person or organization eg customer sponsor performing organization or the public that is actively involved in the project or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by execution or completion of the project a stakeholder may also exert in uence over the project and its deliverables threat a condition or situation unfavorable to the project
